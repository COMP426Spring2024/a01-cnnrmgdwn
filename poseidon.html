        <p class="small">
            Poseidon is known in Greek mythology as being the deity who rules over the sea. Alongside the sea, Poseidon has 
            also been deemed god over storms, earthquakes, and horses, with the sea being his primary domain. Poseidon first
            became lord over the sea after overthrowing his father, Cronus. The domains of the sky, sea, and underworld were 
            then split up amongst him and his brothers, with Poseidon obtaining the sea, ruling over Atlantis.
            <br><br>
            Notably, Poseidon was also referred to as one of the Twelve Olympians, for he was one of the major twelve deities
            who resided atop Mount Olympus in Greece. Poseidon's family consisted of his father, Cronus, and mother, Rhea. His
            consort was Amphitrite, with whom with he bore several children.

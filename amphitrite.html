        <h2>About</h2>
        <p class="small">
            Amphitrite was the goddess and queen of the sea in Greek mythology. Her counterpart
            also being that of Salacia from Roman mythology. Early on, Amphitrite was not seen as a goddess or any sort of deity; However,
            once she started to become acquainted with the Olympian parthenon, she met Poseidon and eventually became his consort. 
            Similarly to Salacia, Amphitrite fled from Poseidon initially, fleeing to the Atlas mountains, but became persuaded 
            after Poseidon had sent one of his dolphins to request for her. Once becoming married to him, she became a symbolic representation 
            of the sea.

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p class="small">Neptune has been named to be the god of the sea in Roman mythology. Originally, he was referred to
            as the god of freshwater, since there was little knowledge of the sea exisiting at the time. Neptune resided
            in a golden palace at the bottom of the sea, holding power over other entities such as ocean gods and goddesses,
            creatures, and nymphs.
            <br>
            <br>
            Neptune always rode on a sea giant or upon dolphins with his wife, Salacia. They often were charioted by
            whales and/or seahorses, always accompanied by other sea gods and nymphs. Their son, Triton, was always 
            loyal to his father, and rode with his parents to announce Neptune's arrival wherever they went. Alongside
            his wife and son, Neptune's family consisted of his father, Saturn, the god of the universe, and his mother,
            Ops, the Earth goddess. His siblings also consisted of two brothers, Jupiter and Pluto, as well as three sisters,
            Ceres, Vesta, and Juno.

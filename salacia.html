        <h2>About</h2>
        <p class="small">
            Salacia, in Roman mythology, was the goddess of the sea and of salt water. She is symbolized by seaweed,
            for she always was said to be wearing a crown made up entirely of it. Salacia gains the title of goddess of
            salt water for actively hiding in the Atlantic Ocean from Neptune, who was in pursuit of her as his wife. In
            Latin, her name is derived from the word meaning salt, representing the wide, open sea. Eventually,
            Salacia agreed to become his consort and married Neptune, becoming the divinity of the sea alongside him.
            <br><br>
            With Neptune, they bore three children, with the most notable being Triton, a creature with the body being of
            half-fish and half-man. Salacia is also recognized as being the representation or counterpart of Amphitrite, from Greek mythology,
            ruling over the same kingdom of the sea and saltwater.
